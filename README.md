Bookmarks and links aggregation website for home usage. Written in Python/Flask.

The main goal of project is to avoid usage of heavy thirdparty websites and tools for web surfing. Also it is focused to provide home-only usage. Right now it is able to keep and manage a list of bookmarks, and very simple read-it-later list.

In plans: pastebin-like service and offline website storage. There are no plans to add any public usage (users/authorization/etc), but if you want, then go ahead :)
